# Week 8 Quiz


### Part 1
The  imaging technique that inspiring me is Cytus II. It's a music game, and the original was made by touching or sliding a circle that grows in a life cycle with your finger, making it pop at the right time according to the beat of the music to get points. I think both the growing and disappearing circles over the life cycle or the interaction here is very inspiring.

### part 2
ctx.scale(x, y)

I can use the parameters x and y to indicate the scaling factors for the x- and y-axes, respectively. This way, all subsequent drawing operations are scaled. There is no need to recalculate the radius of the circle each time.
