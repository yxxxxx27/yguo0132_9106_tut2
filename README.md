# Week 8 Quiz


### Part 1
The  imaging technique that inspiring me is Cytus II. It's a music game, and the original was made by touching or sliding a circle that grows in a life cycle with your finger, making it pop at the right time according to the beat of the music to get points. I think both the growing and disappearing circles over the life cycle or the interaction here is very inspiring.

### part 2
ctx.scale(x, y)

I can use this code to control the zooming in or out of the graphic.
Using ctx.scale() makes it easy to create zoom animations without having to recalculate the coordinates of each drawing instruction, which is more efficient than manually adjusting the coordinates of each drawing instruction.

Also, I can set different scale size for different shapes or parts of shapes. This way only one part of the graphic is used to zoom in while keeping the rest of the graphic at its original size. This makes it easy to draw and manipulate a large number of shapes.
